Literals are fixed values directly written in the code, such as numbers or characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/imharris\/2023\/05\/13\/c-data-types\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"39\">Data Types:<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>C++ data types include primitive types such as int, float, char, bool, and double, as well as derived types such as arrays, pointers, and structures. These data types are used to define variables and specify the type of data they can store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/imharris\/2023\/05\/13\/c-basic-input-output\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"41\">Basic Input &amp; Output:<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In C++, input refers to receiving data from external sources such as the keyboard or files, while output refers to displaying data to the user through the console or writing it to files. These operations are typically achieved using standard input\/output streams (std::cin and std::cout) and stream extraction and insertion operators (>> and &lt;&lt;) respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/imharris\/2023\/05\/13\/c-type-conversion\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"43\">Type Conversion:<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Type conversion in C++ refers to the process of converting one data type to another, allowing the manipulation and interpretation of data in different formats or representations. It can be achieved using explicit or implicit casting operators or by utilizing appropriate conversion functions or constructors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/imharris\/2023\/05\/13\/c-operators\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"45\">Operators:<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In C++, operators are symbols or keywords used to perform various operations, such as arithmetic, logical, and assignment, on operands or variables. They enable concise and powerful expression of computations and manipulations in the language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/imharris\/2023\/05\/13\/c-comments\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"47\">Comments:<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In C++, comments are lines of code that are ignored by the compiler and are used to provide explanations or disable certain code sections. They are denoted by &#8220;\/\/&#8221; for single-line comments or &#8220;\/* *\/&#8221; for multi-line comments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction: C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is used for developing a wide range of applications, including operating systems, browsers, games, and more.
